# dbdis
Full screen telemetry window for Jeti Transmitter to display all kind of sensors for helis, aeroplanes and drones

It bases on the Jlog script  from nichtgedacht: https://github.com/nichtgedacht/JLog-Heli 
  
The dbdis app is specially designed for the jeti transmitters with a coloured display.  
For example the min. values are green, max. values are blue and the alarm values are red, but you can easily change it, how you like them.  
  
* Multible Sensors from different devices selectable  
* Free selection of Device ( JLog2.6, S32 and compatible ) 
* Very easy and fast configuration, most of it is self explaining
* The order of the display values can changed with arrow keys very easy
* Just values are displayed where you have set a sensor value
* A small design helps to diplay a lot of values in one window
* You can use a template design to configure the the full screen window of all models similar
* One switch for permanent percent capacitiy announcement  
* One switch for permanent voltage announcement  
* One switch starts/stops software clock  
* One switch resets software clock  
* One audio file for capacity alarm selectable  
* One audio file for voltage alarm selectable  
* Adjustable capacity of main battery  
* Adjustable voltage of main battery  
* Adjustable cell count of main battery 
* Adjustable voltage alarm theshold  
* Adjustable percent capacity alarm theshold  
* Calculates initial charge condition  
* Displays Tail-Gyro values for Vstabi 
* Displays voltage per cell
* Displays flight time and engine time
* Displays and counts the total amount of flights and total flight time
* Displays the turbine status from the TStatus app: https://github.com/ribid1/TStatus
* Displays the value of Calculated Capacity 4.1 for Gas or Electric, if you don't have a sensor installed:
